# DynaSun_tutorial

This tutorial is an introduction to analysis of STIX data in python tailored to the interests of the DynaSun consortium. 

It includes:
* Downloading STIX data with Fido
* Basic functionality of stixpy
* Reading in the STIX science flarelist
* Quicklook imaging
* An example time series analysis of thermal hard X-ray QPPs

There are various software packages for analysing STIX data written in python and IDL, they are as follows: \n
1. IDL analysis software is available through SSW with the command `ssw_upgrade, /so,/stix,/spawn, /loud, /WGET`. This can also be found on [github](https://github.com/i4Ds/STIX-GSW).
2. Python software is available through [stixpy](https://github.com/TCDSolar/stixpy) which can installed using pip `pip install stixpy`.
